    <p> Vintage is back from the dead. A huge "retro revival is underway in the world of design, fashion, decor and more. What was once considered bargain bin items you couldnt get rid of fast enough are now valued and sought after. Estate sales are popping. Thrift stores are being scoured. Vintage is the future.</p>
<h2> The Trendy Eras</h2>
    <p>Which decades are most popular you wonder? The answer is the 50's through the 70's. Everyone is craving that midcentury modern, atomic, space aged vibe. The 70s flower power movement with groovy mushrooms, flowers and psychadelic colors is all the rage as well.</p>
